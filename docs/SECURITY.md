# Security Features and Considerations

## Current Security Implementation

FZX-Terminal implements basic security practices for a development tool:

### Security Features

- **API key storage**: API keys stored in local config file (`.terminal_data/config.json`)
- **Config file protection**: Config file added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits
- **Input validation**: Basic validation on user commands
- **Local operation**: No data sent to external servers except API calls to OpenRouter/Gemini

## Security Notice

⚠️ **Important**: FZX-Terminal stores API keys in plaintext in your local config file. 

Take these precautions:

1. **Never commit** `.terminal_data/` to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for API keys in production
3. **Restrict file permissions**: 
   ```bash
   chmod 600 .terminal_data/config.json  # Unix/Linux/macOS
   ```
4. **Rotate API keys regularly**
5. **Use separate API keys** for development and production

## Best Practices

### For Solo Developers
- Keep your API keys private
- Don't share config files
- Use separate keys for different projects
- Monitor your API usage regularly

### For Team Development
- Use environment variables instead of config files
- Set up proper access controls
- Consider using API key management services
- Document security procedures for your team

## What FZX-Terminal Does NOT Do

FZX-Terminal is a development tool, not a production security system:

- ❌ Does not implement enterprise-grade encryption
- ❌ Does not have SOC 2 Type II compliance
- ❌ Does not meet ISO 27001 standards
- ❌ Is not HIPAA ready
- ❌ Does not comply with PCI DSS
- ❌ Does not include audit logging
- ❌ Does not have user authentication

## Security Recommendations

### Securing Your Environment

1. **File Permissions**:
   ```bash
   # Make config file readable only by you
   chmod 600 .terminal_data/config.json
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Instead of storing in config, use environment variables
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key-here"
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
   ```

3. **Git Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure .terminal_data is in .gitignore
   echo ".terminal_data/" >> .gitignore
   ```

### Code Security

Always review generated code for:
- Hardcoded credentials
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Insecure API endpoints
- Missing input validation
- Weak authentication mechanisms

### API Key Security

- Use the minimum required permissions
- Set up billing alerts
- Monitor API usage for anomalies
- Revoke and rotate keys regularly
- Use different keys for different environments

## Disclaimer

FZX-Terminal is designed as a development productivity tool for solo developers and small teams. It is not designed for enterprise security environments or handling sensitive data. Always review and test generated code before deploying to production environments.
