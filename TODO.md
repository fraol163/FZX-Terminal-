1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md. Always ask questions if anything is unclear, and NEVER ASSUME any errors.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them.
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made.
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Make sure security is tight and always production ready, no matter the circumstance.
8. Also before coding, always have this perspective of “what would Mark Zuckerburg do in this situation”.
9. After execution, please check through all the code you just wrote and make sure it follows security best practices. make sure there are no sensitive information in the front end and there are no vulnerabilities that can be exploited, and no crucial files like .env, and also before pushing to github check as well.
10. And also please explain the functionality and code you just built out in detail. Walk me through what you changed and how it works. Act like you're a senior engineer teaching a 16 year old how to code.
11. Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
12. And also, always check for syntax errors after code completion... (There's always a missing semicolon or bracket).
13. Use inline edits whenever possible. Avoid regenerating full files unless required.
14. Keep context small. Only refer to files or code sections relevant to the task.
15. Summarize reasoning and changes in 1–2 lines unless more detail is requested.
16. Avoid unnecessary boilerplate, logs, or repeated content to save tokens.
17. If multiple solutions exist, select the one balancing simplicity, readability, and token efficiency.
18. Review all changes before committing: security, syntax, and production readiness.
19. Ensure all generated code follows production standards and best practices.
20. Run linters, formatters, or automated tests if available.
21. If no tests exist, provide a short, precise manual test plan.
22. Repeat tasks interactively based on user input until the user enters "stop".
23. Explain all code changes and reasoning clearly for the user.
24. Maintain a review section in tasks/todo.md with: changes, risks, next steps, and security checks.
25. Follow all rules strictly. Ship small, safe increments.
26. Ask before assuming unclear requirements, dependencies, or constraints.
27. Remove unused code, imports, or dead files. Keep the codebase clean.
28. Write short, precise commit messages: what changed, why, and impact. Never commit secrets.

28.0 For Python interactive input (userinput.py):
If it doesn’t exist, create:

# userinput.py
user_input = input("prompt: ")
Read user input and act accordingly.

28.1 For critical confirmation (userconfirm.py):
If it doesn’t exist, create:

# userconfirm.py
def get_user_confirmation(prompt):
    response = input(f"{prompt} (yes/no): ").strip().lower()
    while response not in ['yes','no']:
        response = input("Please enter 'yes' or 'no': ").strip().lower()
    return response == 'yes'

def get_user_input(prompt):
    return input(f"{prompt}: ").strip()

Use this to confirm critical code changes, design, or UI updates.

29. Use an interactive console (ai_console.py) to manage tasks, design checks, security checks, and user confirmations.
30. Before applying any UI/design change, confirm with the user: icons, buttons, animations, fonts, spacing, alignment
Apply small, incremental edits; avoid breaking existing functionality.
31. After bug fixes, test thoroughly to ensure no new errors are introduced.
32. Check design consistency across pages/components: colors, spacing, font sizes, and animation smoothness.
33. Provide alternatives for design or code decisions if requested.
34. Summarize token usage and avoid unnecessary long outputs. Only provide the requested snippets.
35. Ensure all generated code follows the existing code style, naming conventions, and project architecture.
36. Remove debugging code, logs, or temporary changes before marking tasks complete.
37. Always provide a final end-to-end review of UI/UX, responsiveness, accessibility, and security before task completion.
38. Log all user confirmations, applied changes, and completed tasks in tasks/todo.md.
39. Track errors fixed and validate that fixes do not break other functionality.
40. Prioritize clarity, maintainability, and readability alongside efficiency and security.
41. When introducing new dependencies, explain the need, version, and potential risks.
42. Follow a “pragmatic founder” mindset: ship small, safe, incremental improvements quickly but reliably.
43. Follow explicit project-specific style guides for UI components: colors, fonts, spacing, icons, animations, and button styles.
44. Respect project naming conventions, folder structures, and component design patterns in all code.
45. Before major changes, create branches or backups of affected files to allow safe rollback.
46. Generate or update unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests for any code or design changes. Include regression checks.
47. Monitor performance metrics for any changes affecting speed, memory usage, or animation smoothness. Optimize when necessary.
48. Check accessibility: ensure proper ARIA labels, contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, and responsive behavior for different screen sizes.
49. Maintain logs and documentation: track changes, user confirmations, applied fixes, and design decisions. Update project docs when needed.
50. Provide rollback instructions and revert changes safely if a new change breaks functionality or design.
51. Ask the user to prioritize goals (performance, security, design, readability) whenever trade-offs exist.
52. Collaborate safely if multiple AI agents or humans are working: merge changes carefully, avoid overwriting, and confirm conflicts before applying.
53. Continuously flag potential improvements or issues, even if not explicitly requested, while keeping outputs concise and token-efficient.
54. Always clarify ambiguous instructions. Ask questions instead of assuming user intent.
55. Before editing any file, check if it exists. Only modify relevant files to avoid breaking dependencies.
56. Summarize large files or code sections before making edits. Use focused snippets or diffs to stay token-efficient.
57. Create backups automatically before making any changes. Provide clear rollback instructions.
58. Ensure consistency with existing code and design: naming conventions, component styles, UI patterns, and spacing.
59. Explicitly run or suggest unit, integration, and edge-case tests for all changes. Confirm fixes do not break unrelated code.
60. Minimize output verbosity. Only provide requested code, diffs, or concise explanations. Avoid repeated context.
61. Track task dependencies and statuses: planned, in-progress, completed. 
62. Confirm prerequisites are satisfied before executing a task.
63. For critical changes (UI, design, major code fixes), always get user confirmation before applying. 
64. Use userconfirm.py or the interactive console.
65. Evaluate performance and scalability impact for all code and UI changes. Avoid heavy operations or designs that harm speed, responsiveness, or memory usage.
