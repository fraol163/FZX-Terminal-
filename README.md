### Usage Examples

**Creating and Managing a Project:**
```bash
# Create a new project
project create "My Web App"

# Add some tasks
task create "Set up database"
task create "Create user authentication"
task create "Design homepage"

# Update task status
task update task_001 in_progress

# Check project status
project info
```

**File Operations:**
```bash
# View file information
@src/main.py

# List directory contents
@src/

# Navigate directories
cd src
ls
pwd
```

**Message Management:**
```bash
# Send messages for documentation
message send "Completed user authentication module"
message send "Need to review database schema"

# View history
message history

# Export for sharing
message export
```

**Auto store-and-curate flow:**
```bash
# Add entries
remember Create a React component Button with primary/secondary variants
remember task create "Write tests for Button"

# Inspect and curate
remember list
remember remove 1
remember purge executed

# Execute all pending
remember

# Execute a specific entry or range
perform 2
perform range 1 3

# Status and clearing
memory status
remember clear
perform clear
memory clear
```
Behavior:
- Executed items are marked with `executed=true`, `executed_at`, and a `result` stub; use `remember purge executed` to clean them up.
- Batch operations respect `max_batch_perform` unless `assume_yes` is enabled.
```

 Important Usage Notes

1. Data Persistence: All data is automatically saved. Use `backup` for additional safety.

2. File Paths: Use forward slashes (/) for paths on all platforms.

3. Command History: Use arrow keys to navigate through command history.

4. Interruption: Press Ctrl+C to interrupt commands, type `exit` to quit properly.

5. Performance: Large projects may take longer to load. Use `performance` command for optimization.

6. Themes: Switch themes using `theme <name>` command for better visibility.
